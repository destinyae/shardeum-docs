## Detailed Setup Process

As the name suggests, one-click node setup require far fewer steps and technical know-how to setup a node when compared to self-hosting. You simply need to choose a suitable service provider available in the market, pay a service fee and let them handle all the technical aspects for you to run the node seamlessly while you earn rewards. Follow the steps below to get started:


### 1. Choose a Service Provider
Visit the [providers list](/docs/node/run/validator/node-providers) and choose the provider that best suits your needs and budget.
The process is similar for all providers, but the exact steps may vary slightly. Here is a general overview of the process:

### 2. Account Creation
- Navigate to your chosen provider's website
- Provide the required information and create an account

### 3. Payment and Activation
- Complete the payment process
- Look for a list of available options to "Deploy Node" 
- Select Shardeum from the list of available networks

### 4. Start Validating
