---

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up a Shardeum Validator using Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances.

## Prerequisites

- An active AWS account with billing enabled
- Basic familiarity with AWS EC2 service and AWS Console navigation
- Understanding of SSH connections and key pair management
- A terminal application for SSH access
- The minimum hardware requirements for running a validator

## Instance Setup

### 1. Launch EC2 Instance

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com
2. Navigate to EC2 Dashboard:
   - Click on "Services" in the top navigation bar
   - Select "EC2" under Compute services
   - Ensure you're in your preferred region (top-right corner)
3. Click the orange "Launch Instance" button
4. Configure your instance:
   - Name your instance (e.g., "shardeum-validator")
   - Under "Application and OS Images":
     - Select "Ubuntu" as the AMI
     - Choose "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM)" 
   - Under "Instance Type":
     - Select an instance that [meets minimum requirements](/docs/node/run/validator/self-host#minimum-hardware-requirements)
     - Recommended: t3.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM)
     - For production: Consider t3.2xlarge for better performance
   - Create or select a key pair:
     - Click "Create new key pair" if you don't have one
     - Name your key pair
     - Select RSA and .pem format
     - Download and securely store your key pair file
5. Configure storage:
   - Click "Configure Storage"
   - Set root volume to at least 250 GB gp3 SSD

### 2. Configure Security Group

Create a new security group with the following rules:
- SSH (Port 22): Your IP
- Custom TCP (Port 8080): Anywhere (Dashboard)
- Custom TCP (Port 9001): Anywhere (P2P)
- Custom TCP (Port 10001): Anywhere (P2P)

### 3. Connect to Your Instance

Use SSH to connect to your instance:

```bash
chmod 400 your-key-pair.pem
ssh -i your-key-pair.pem user@your-instance-public-dns
```

### 4. Installing Shardeum

Once your AWS instance is ready, follow our [Base Guide for Running a Shardeum Validator Node](/docs/node/run/validator/self-host#download-and-install-validator) for detailed installation instructions, including the steps to open the validator dashboard, stake SHM, start the validator, and more.
