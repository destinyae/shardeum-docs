description: Steps to run a Shardeum Validator using a VPS / Cloud Provider
---

This guide provides instructions for setting up a Shardeum Validator using a VPS (Virtual Private Server) service like Google Cloud Platform (GCP, Contabo, Digital Ocean, AWS EC2, etc.)

### Detailed Setup Process

This approach offers more control over infrastructure compared to self-hosting. It requires selecting a cloud provider and configuring a server that meets Shardeum's node requirements. After setup, you'll use SSH to connect and launch the validator.

**Key steps:**
### 1. Choose a Cloud Provider
The choice of cloud provider is largely a matter of personal preference. Here are some of the most popular options in our community:
  - Contabo
  - Google Cloud Platform, etc

### 2. Server Configuration Requirements
Ensure your server meets the [minimum requirements](/docs/node/run/validator/self-host#minimum-hardware-requirements)

### 3. Instance Launch Process
1. Log in to your chosen cloud provider and create a new instance, droplet, or virtual machine
2. Open required ports: (port 9001, 8080 and 10001 )

### 4. Connect to your server

Depending on the cloud provider, you can connect to your server using the provider's console or SSH.

```bash
# Connect to your server
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-server-ip

# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install required dependencies
sudo apt install -y curl docker.io docker-compose
```

### 5. Security Configuration

```bash
# Configure UFW firewall
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp  # Dashboard
sudo ufw allow 9001/tcp  # Validator port
sudo ufw allow 10001/tcp  # Validator port
sudo ufw enable

# (OPTIONAL) Create dedicated user
sudo adduser shardeum
sudo usermod -aG docker shardeum
sudo usermod -aG sudo shardeum
```

### 6. Launch the node

```bash
# Switch to shardeum user
su - shardeum

# Download installer
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shardeum/validator-dashboard/dev/installer.sh && chmod +x installer.sh && ./installer.sh
```

### 7. Dashboard Access

- Open web browser
- Navigate to https://YOUR-SERVER-IP:8080
- Create password at first login
Complete initial setup:
  - Connect wallet
  - Stake required SHM
  - Start validator
